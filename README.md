## Spincounting Toolbox

A MatLab toolbox for quantitative EPR.

### Overview
This MatLab toolbox is designed to facilitate and automate the evaluation of quantitative EPR data.

### System Requirements
 * MatLab 2013b or later
 * Optimisation Toolbox (only when using the lorentz and gauss model for resonator dip fitting)
 * [easyspin](http://easyspin.org) (only for loading Bruker BES3T and Magnetec XML files).

### Versions
Current master branch:

`git clone http://github.com/lcts/spincounting`

Release branch:

`git clone http://github.com/lcts/spincounting --branch release`

### Installation & first steps
Add the spincounting folder to your MatLab search path. Read and follow documentation/INSTALL.
The toolbox is invoked by typing 'spincounting' on the MatLab command line.

### Upgrading from v2.x.x
Version 3.0.0 of spincounting introduced machine files and various changes to scconfig as well as
the output format. To migrate your configuration from v2.x.x to 3.x.x, you should, after updating

 - copy your `scconfig.m` to `scconfig.m.backup`
 - copy `documentation/templates/scconfig.m.template` to `private/scconfig`
 - copy the options you set in the `DEFAULTS` variable in `scconfig.m.backup` to either
   `DEFAULT_OPTIONS` in scconfig or `MACHINE_PARAMETERS` in a machine file, as applicatble.
 - If you used any self-written load routines, copy them from sccontig.m.backup to scconfig.n. Note
   that the new scconfig uses a single variable `<TUNE|SPECTRUM>_FORMATS` instead of the old
   `<TUNE|SPECTRUM>_KNOWN_FORMATS` and `<TUNE|SPECTRUM>_LOADFUNCTIONS`.

Additionally, v3.x.x no longer returns `[nspins, tfactor, outstr]`, but `[out, outstr]`, where 'out'
contains nspins, tfactor or nspinerror depending on the operation mode. All values are still saved
individually to the struct output outstr. The structure of outstr has changed as well. You need to
edit your scripts accordingly.
