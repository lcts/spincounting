v0.9.1
 - fixed regresseion where dint instead of dintnorm was used to calculate nspins
 - fixed error where dintnorm was needlessly scaled with specparams.Sensitivity
v0.9.2
 - implemented saving of results
 - added nosave switch
v0.9.3
 - fixed an error where the program would delete existing figures that did not belong to it
 - added q factor as a settable parameter
 - changed handle variables for figures, plots and axes to be more readable
 - included warning if data is not being saved
 - moved manual from spincounting.m head comment to README
 - changed spincounting.m head comment to comply with MATLAB help system
 - fixed error where spectrum bg indices are not displayed when q is passed
v0.9.4
 - fixed error where spectrum was saved twice instead of dip
 - fixed error in 'nofit' model
v1.0
 - implemented gaussian model
 - changed output to include all data generated by the script
 - simplified returned variables
v1.2
 - added support for dat2 format
 - fixed calculation of Boltzmann factor
 - background in spectrum now specified by x value instead of index (adds new function iof() from EPR helperfunctions)
v1.2.1
 - fixed error where Boltzmann factor would become infinite
v1.2.2
 - fixed wrong frequency scaling for dat2-files in GetSpecFile.m
 - added examples to README
v1.2.3
 - fixed error when using different orders for first and second bg correction in DoubleInt
v2.0.0
 - API CHANGE: Some syntax changes: intparams.optionname & qparams.optionname replaced by direct options
 - API CHANGE: tfactor's definition is changed to follow convention in literature (DI = tfactor * constants * spins)
               tfactor_new = 1/tfactor_old
 - improved background fitting and choice of default values
 - more paramters taken into account
 - added support for multiple new file (Bruker Xepr, MatLab .mat, struct input, generic ascii)
 - all parameters can be set via input option or read from file
 - new configuration file to set defaults
 - universal interface for new loading functions
 - extended documentation
v2.1.1
 - spincounting now displays the field/frequency values used as bg limits instead of indices
 - spincounting now switches to nosave mode if file selection dialog is aborted, after prompting the user
 - fixed bug where FitResDip would prompt user for invalid option 'background'
 - fixed bug where FitResDip would report itself as DoubleInt in error message
 - fixed LoadMat returning improperly named parameter struct
 - fixed bug caused by multiple frequencies being present in dat2/ch1/ch2-files
v3.0.0
 - API CHANGE: the output are now [out, outstr] instead of [nspins, tfactor, outstr]. 'out' contains nspins
               or tfactor depending on the mode. Both nspins and tfactor are still saved to the results array
               individually
 - API CHANGE: output struct reorganised
 - CONFIG CHANGE: format of scconfig changed
 - CONFIG CHANGE: spincounting now supports per-machine configurations
 - REQUIREMENTS: now requires Matlab R213b
 - existing configurations are no longer overwritten during installation
 - q value can now be read from spectrum file as well as input manually/determined from tune pic file
 - spincounting now asks for spectrum file first, then tune file. This is necessary for getting q from spectrum
   file params
 - changed input validation to allow negative and non-integer background limits
 - added support for screenshots as tune picture files (experimental)
 - added support for Magnetec XML files
 - added support for saving reults to a .mat-file
 - failure to fit the dip in tune file no longer aborts program execution
