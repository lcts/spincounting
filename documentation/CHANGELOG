spincounting changelog

v0.9.1
 - fixed regresseion where dint instead of dintnorm was used to calculate nspins
 - fixed error where dintnorm was needlessly scaled with specparams.Sensitivity
v0.9.2
 - implemented saving of results
 - added nosave switch
v0.9.3
 - fixed an error where the program would delete existing figures that did not belong to it
 - added q factor as a settable parameter
 - changed handle variables for figures, plots and axes to be more readable
 - included warning if data is not being saved
 - moved manual from spincounting.m head comment to README
 - changed spincounting.m head comment to comply with MATLAB help system
 - fixed error where spectrum bg indices are not displayed when q is passed
v0.9.4
 - fixed error where spectrum was saved twice instead of dip
 - fixed error in 'nofit' model
v1.0
 - implemented gaussian model
 - changed output to include all data generated by the script
 - simplified returned variables 
v1.2
 - added dat2 format
 - fixed calculation of Boltzmann factor
 - background in spectrum now specified by x value instead of index (adds new function iof() from EPR helperfunctions)
v1.2.1
 - fixed error where Boltzmann factor would become infinite
v1.2.2
 - fixed wrong frequency scaling for dat2-files in GetSpecFile.m
 - added examples to README
v1.2.3
 - fixed error when using different orders for first and second bg correction in DoubleInt
v2.0
 - improved background fitting and choice of default values
 - more paramters taken into account
 - new file formats (Bruker Xepr, MatLab .mat, struct input, generic ascii)
 - all parameters can be set via input option or read from file
 - new configuration file to set defaults
 - universal interface for new loading functions
 - extended documentation
 - CAUTION: Some syntax changes: intparams.optionname & qparams.optionname replaced by direct options
 - CAUTION: tfactor's definition is changed to follow convention in literature (DI = tfactor * constants * spins)
            tfactor_new = 1/tfactor_old
v2.1
 - fixed in loading functions: variable for parameters in struct/mat-file is 'params', not 'pars'
