1) SUPPORTED FILE FORMATS

1.1) Data for Q-factor determination (tune picture)

Currently, the toolbox supports as a source for the tune picture

 - Tektronics-oscilloscope .CSV files
 - generic ascii files with either two lines or two columns containing frequency and intensity data
 - loading data from a MatLab-file (.mat)
 - passing data directly to the toolbox as a MatLab variable

1.2) EPR data 

Currently, the toolbox supports the following EPR data files

 - its own format (.scs)
 - Bruker Xepr (.DTA, .DSC) via easyspin's eprload() function
 - two data formats used by software employed at Freie Universit√§t Berlin (.akku and .akku2)
 - loading data from a MatLab-file (.mat)
 - passing data directly to the toolbox as a MatLab variable

2) VALID PARAMETERS

The toolbox understands the following parameters

Attenuation or pwr*
Frequency*
ModAmp*
Temperature*
S
maxpwr
gain
nscans
tc

Starred (*) parameters are needed for quantitative analysis. If they are not read from file, they have to be specified manually.
When the real microwave power 'pwr' is not specified, 'attenuation' has to be. If both are present, 'pwr' takes precedence.

When writing your own loading routine, only read parameters from the file that actually change the signal amplitude. If e.g. your machine automatically averages scans, don't set the 'nscans' parameter or set it to 1 regardless of the number of scans.
 
The requirements for the different formats are listed below.

3) WRITING YOUR OWN LOADING ROUTINE

4) DESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL FORMATS

4.1) LOADING FROM STRUCT

4.2) .MAT FILES (MATLAB BINARY FILE)

4.1) .SCSPEC FILES (SPINCOUNTING TOOLBOX FORMAT)

.scspec is a simple, generic ascii file format that can be read by the spincounting toolbox. It is designed to be used when your data files' format is not implemented in the toolbox. Usually, adding the necessary parameters (see below) to any ascii or .csv data file should be enough for the toolbox to load it as .scspec.

An example -scspec file can be found in the examples-folder, the following explains the format in detail.

4.1.1) Parameters

Lines containing parameters start with '%!', followed by the parameter name, its value and, optionally, its unit, all separated by spaces, e.g.:

%! Attenuation 30 dB

These lines can appear anywhere in the file.

4.1.2) Data

Lines that are not parameters contain the data for the x- (field-) and y- (EPR-signal-) axes. The data can be written as two lines or two columns, values can be separated by space, tab, comma or semicolon.

4.2) .DTA/.DSC FILES (BRUKER XEPR BES3T FORMAT)

In order to load .DTA and .DSC files, the function 'eprload()' from Stefan Stoll's easyspin toolbox (www.easyspin.org) is needed. By default, the Xepr software normalises the data for time constant, receiver gain and number of scans. Accordingly, these parameters are not read from the file.
If Xepr measured the temperature, this parameter is read from the file, otherwise you'll have to specify it manually.
