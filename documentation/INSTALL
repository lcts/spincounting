1) DOWNLOAD & INSTALLATION

1.1) Release versions:

Download the most recent release from https://github.com/lcts/spincounting/releases and unpack to
a folder of your choice. If you have git installed on your computer, you can also get the most
recent release via

  git clone https://github.com/lcts/spincounting.git --branch release
  
This will result in a folder 'spincounting' at the location you executed git from.

1.2) Git (Development) versions:
You can either get a current snapshot of the git development branch by downloading 

  https://github.com/lcts/spincounting/archive/master.zip

or (recommended) by using git directly

  git clone https://github.com/lcts/spincounting.git

This will result in a folder 'spincounting' at the location you executed git from.

1.3) Editing Matlab path

To allow Matlab to use the spincounting program, from within Matlab, add the folder you saved it to
with subfolders to the Matlab path (Matlab Home -> Set Path).


2) CONFIGURATION

spincounting is configured via a main configuration file, located at private/scconfig.m, which
determines various aspects of default program behaviour, and optionally spectrometer-specific
configuration files, located at private/machines/<machinename>.m, which set default experimental
parameters specific to a given setup.
These files are not shipped with spincounting by default, but can be generated from templates:

  a) Copy & rename documentation/templates/scconfig.m.template to private/scconfig.m
  b) Optionally, copy & rename documentation/templates/machine.m.template to
     private/machines/<machinename>.m . <machinename> can be any alphanumeric string that allows
     you to identify the spectrometer it is referring to, but should not contain spaces.
  c) Edit scconfig.m to suit your needs. If you're not sure, you can leave it as is. If you're using
     a machine file, you should put 'machine', '<machinename>'; ... in the DEFAULT_OPTIONS array
     (see below)
  d) Do the same for the machine file. If you do not want 

2.1) Options in scconfig

CONFIG_VERSION    : This option is used by spincounting to determine if the configuration needs an
                    update after installation. Don't change this unless spincounting tells you to.
ALLOW_ALL_OPTIONS : By default, some parameters can only be set in scconfig, others only in machine
                    files, following their different roles described above. If you only have one
                    setup and would like to just use scconfig for everything, set
                    'ALLOW_ALL_OPTIONS = true', though machine files are the preferred method even
                    for a single setup.
DEFAULT_OPTIONS   : Used to set up default program behaviour. Unless ALLOW_ALL_OPTIONS is set, every
                    option listed as <VALID IN> scconfig in the README can be set here. The syntax
                    is that of a Nx2 cell array:
                    
                    { 'option1', value1; 'option2', value2; ... }
                    
TUNE_FORMATS      : Used to tell spincounting about usable loading functions for tune picture files.
                    Only needs to be changed if you've written your own. This is a Nx3 cell array:
                    
                    { '*.<extension1>, '*.<extension2>', '<description>', '<function to run>'; ... }
                    
                    where <function to run> is the name of the function and extension1...N are all
                    extensions this routine is responsible for.

SPECTRUM_FORMATS  : Same as TUNE_FORMATS, but for spectrum files.


2.2) Options in machine files

Machine files contain only a single variable

MACHINE_PARAMETERS   : Used to set up default measurement parameters. Unless ALLOW_ALL_OPTIONS is
                       set, every option listed as <VALID IN> machinefile in the README can be set
                       here. The syntax is the same as that of DEFAULT_OPTIONS, a Nx2 cell array:
                    
                       { 'option1', value1; 'option2', value2; ... }


3) UPGRADING

Since spincounting does not ship scconfig and machine files directly, you can upgrade by simply
downloading a new version and overwriting the old. If the upgrade necessitates changes to the
configuration, spincounting will notify the user on first run.

Upgrading is particularly easy if you used git to get the program. In that case, just change to the
installation folder and type

  git pull
  
You can easily switch between release and development version by typing

  git checkout master
  git pull
  
to switch from release to develop, and

  git checkout release
  git pull
  
to switch from develop to release.


4) MIGRATING FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS

Version 3.0.0 of spincounting introduced machine files and various changes to scconfig as well as
the output format. To migrate your configuration from v2.x.x to 3.x.x, you should, after updating

  a) copy your scconfig.m to scconfig.m.backup
  b) copy documentation/templates/scconfig.m.template to private/scconfig
  c) copy the options you set in the DEFAULTS variable in scconfig.m.backup to either
     DEFAULT_OPTIONS in scconfig or MACHINE_PARAMETERS in a machine file, as applicatble.
  d) If you used any self-written load routines, copy them from sccontig.m.backup to scconfig.n. Note
     that the new scconfig uses a single variable <TUNE|SPECTRUM>_FORMATS instead of the old
     <TUNE|SPECTRUM>_KNOWN_FORMATS and <TUNE|SPECTRUM>_LOADFUNCTIONS.

Additionally, v3.x.x no longer returns [nspins, tfactor, outstr], but [out, outstr], where 'out'
contains nspins, tfactor or nspinerror depending on the operation mode. All values are still saved
individually to the struct output outstr. The structure of outstr has changed as well. You need to
edit your scripts accordingly.
